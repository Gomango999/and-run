# And Run
And Run is a cli tool that aids in speeding up the repetitive tasks in competitive programming. This includes initialising cpp files with templates, automatically compiling and running on the most likely cpp and input files, initalising contest workspaces and navigating problem folders.

This tool is still under development and is missing many key features.

## Usage
```
and run
```
Finds the most likely cpp file, and most likely input text file, then compiles and runs your program on that. It will print out the input and output, next to each other for easy comparison, as well as the time taken to run the program.

## Upcoming features
- Ability to compare output with brute force algorithms, and easily find discrepant test cases.
- Easier navigation of problems
- Time tracking and analysis for problem submission/acceptance
- Initialising cpp files with templates
- Eaiser navigation

## Technologies
This was coded in python using the click library
